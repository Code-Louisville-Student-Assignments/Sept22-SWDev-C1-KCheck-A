# Software Dev. Course 1 Knowledge Check

## Instructions:

Clone this repo using your command terminal: https://github.com/Code-Louisville-Student-Assignments/Sept22-SWDev-C1-KCheck-A.git 

This calculator has addition, subtraction, and division already implemented.  

You will need to create the functionality for multiplication.

Use the other functions as an example of what to do.

### Optional

See if you can find code that could be moved to a method and then reused in multiple places.  
Refactor the code and run a few tests to make sure it works.

Hint: The part where the code gets the numbers to use in the math operations all look very similar.
